			<p>
			A robot is a mechanical or virtual artificial agent, usually an electro-mechanical machine that is guided by a computer program or electronic circuitry. Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and range from humanoids to industrial robots, collectively programmed swarm robots, and even microscopic nano robots. By mimicking a lifelike appearance or automating movements, a robot may convey a sense of intelligence or thought of its own.
			</p>
			<p>
			The branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing is robotics. These technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes, or resemble humans in appearance, behavior, and/or cognition. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics. These robots have also created a newer branch of robotics: Soft robotics.

			<p>
			From the time of ancient civilization there have been many accounts of user-configurable automated devices and even automata resembling animals and humans, designed primarily as entertainment. As mechanical techniques developed through the Industrial age, t 1948. The first digitalhere appeared more practical applications such as automated machines, remote-control and wireless remote-control. Electronics evolved into the driving force of development with the advent of the first electronic autonomous robots created by William Grey Walter in Bristol, England in and programmable robot was invented by George Devol in 1954 and was named the Unimate. It was sold to General Motors in 1961 where it was used to lift pieces of hot metal from die casting machines at the Inland Fisher Guide Plant in the West Trenton section of Ewing Township, New Jersey.

			Robots have replaced humans in the assistance of performing those repetitive and dangerous tasks which humans prefer not to do, or are unable to do due to size limitations, or even those such as in outer space or at the bottom of the sea where humans could not survive the extreme environments.
			</p>
			<p>
			There are concerns about the increasing use of robots and their role in society. Robots are blamed for rising unemployment as they replace workers in increasing numbers of functions. The use of robots in military combat raises ethical concerns. The possibilities of robot autonomy and potential repercussions have been addressed in fiction and may be a realistic concern in the future.

		<h1 id="titles1"><em>Soccer Robot</em></h1>
			<span><img src="soccer robot.png" /></span>
			<p>
				A soccer robot is a specialized autonomous robot and mobile robot that is used to play variants of soccer.
				It can be in a humanoid form or in a form with wheels. 
			</p>
			<h1 id="titles2"><em>Rescue Robot</em></h1>
			<p>
				A rescue robot is a robot that has been designed for the purpose of rescuing people.Common situations that employ rescue robots are mining accidents, urban disasters, hostage situations, and explosions. Rescue robots were used in the search for victims and survivors after the September 11 attacks in New York. The benefits of rescue robots to these operations include reduced personnel requirements, reduced fatigue, and access to otherwise unreachable areas.

			<h1 id="titles3"><em>Fighting Robot</em></h1>
			<span><img src="fighting robot.png" /></span>
			<p>
				Robot combat is a hobby/sport in which two or more custom-built machines use varied methods of destroying or disabling the other. As of today, in most cases these machines are remote-controlled vehicles rather than autonomous robots, although there are exceptions, particularly in the field of robot-sumo.

			<h1 id="titles4"><em>Competitions</em></h1>
			<p>
			There are alot of competitions all over the world for all kind of robots. One of the biggest competitions for elementry students to university students is the RoboCup.You can compete for soccer robots ,rescue robots ,and dance robots. Within, the soccer category in the competition is the most important. 
			</p>
			<h1 id="titles5"><em>Other Robots</em></h1>
			<p>
			Ther are many other kinds of robots. For example dance robots,simulations, and more. The field of robotics is very big ,and I encourage you to learn as much as you can;
